# This project was created for learning purposes following the yt video
[Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk&t=202s)

I highly recommend the course, it teaches a lot of the basics for nextjs, and it helps you to get on track with other tools, like mongo and vercel in this case.

## There are some changes
- The tutoral was made for nextjs 13, but I made it in nextjs 15 which means, it's not a 1 to 1 match.
- I tend to change the language of the text not related to code to spanish, since it helps me to keep my focus on the code however, all the code is in english.
- I had to make some changes to the css since the background for the textarea and input were not working for me.
